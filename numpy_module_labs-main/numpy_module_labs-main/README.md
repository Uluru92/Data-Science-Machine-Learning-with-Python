# NumPy Labs

Welcome to the NumPy labs. These are designed to help you practice all your NumPy skills!

**Note**: If any exercises require techniques we haven't covered yet - you should look this up! It's part of the learning process, we need to build the muscle of learning how to do things we haven't seen before.

Don't be shy, ask for help on Discord!
